-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            Verify program correctness by splitting it up and handing it off to VerCors

-- A longer description of the package.
description:
  When verifying correctness of something, you quickly accumulate tools, assumptions and tests.
  This tool is meant for people who just care about correctness, and helps you keep track of all the tools, assumptions and tool-executions you used to establish correctness.
  We want this tool to be practically usable and user friendly, and the primary audience is that of people who wish to verify the correctness of Java programs using VerCors.
  Currently, installing VerCors is a prerequisite, and only Java (and perhaps pvl) programs can be verified with it.
